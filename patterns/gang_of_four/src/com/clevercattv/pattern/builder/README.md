# Builder

## Description

Builder is a design pattern that lets you construct complex object step by step. 
The pattern allows you to produce different types and representations 
of an object using the same construction code.

### Use when

* you want your code to be able to create different representations of some product
* you need create a complex object that should be independent of the parts 
  that make up the object and how they're assembled

Maybe you hate Lombok, but it can create builders instead of you.
(just don't look inside generated classes...)
