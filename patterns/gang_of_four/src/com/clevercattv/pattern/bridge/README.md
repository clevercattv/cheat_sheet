# Bridge

## Description

Bridge is a structural design pattern that lets you split a large class or a set of closely related classes into 
two separate hierarchies—abstraction and implementation—which can be developed independently of each other.

### Use when

* you want to divide and organize a monolithic class that has several variants of some functionality
* you need to extend a class in several dimensions
* if you need to be able to switch implementations at runtime

### Good example
